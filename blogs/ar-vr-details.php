                            <p>AR and VR have found many applications in the field of healthcare. Here are some ways
                                they are
                                being used:</p>
                           
                                <h5>Remote Surgery : </h5>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>AR & VR are being used to enable remote surgery, enabling surgeons to perform

                                        without actually being in the operating room.
                                        This could help revolutionize surgery, making it even faster and safer.
                                </li>
</ul>
                                <h5>Dental Surgery : </h5>
